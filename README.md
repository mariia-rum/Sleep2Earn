### **Project Concept:**

Sleep2Earn tackles the growing issue of sleep deprivation in modern society. Poor sleep negatively impacts productivity, mental health, and overall well-being. The app incentivizes better sleep by rewarding users with tokens for meeting predefined sleep goals, verified securely using zkTLS. Users gain rewards without compromising sensitive health data, ensuring privacy.

**Problem Solved:** Encouraging healthier sleep habits through a gamified and secure platform that respects user privacy.

**Solution Offered:** Users connect sleep-tracking devices (e.g., smartwatches) to the app. zkTLS verifies the authenticity of sleep data (e.g., duration, quality) without exposing raw metrics. Rewards are distributed in the form of tokens that can be redeemed for discounts, gift cards, or other perks.
